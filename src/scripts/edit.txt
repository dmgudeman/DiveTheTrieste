In the absence of sunlight, this zone has low temperatures, high pressure, and limited nutrient availability. 
Despite these challenges, the zone is not devoid of life. Unique and highly adapted 
organisms inhabit this realm, relying on alternative energy sources and survival strategies.
In this zone, the primary producers are CHEMOSYNTHETIC bacteria that derive energy 
from inorganic compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide or methane. 
These bacteria serve as the foundation of the food chain, supporting a variety of organisms that are 
adapted to survive in extreme conditions. Deep-sea fish, cephalopods, and other invertebrates, 
some with bioluminescent abilities, are found here.
The aphotic pelagic zone plays a significant role in the cycling of organic matter
and the global carbon cycle. Organic particles, called marine snow, sink from the surface waters 
providing sustenance. The marine snow transports carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, sequestering it for long 
periods and influencing the planet's carbon balance.
