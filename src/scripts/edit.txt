There is no light. It is usually just above freezing and over 1000 times the pressure of the atmosphere. 
Most of this zone is nutrient poor however there is also the remarkable  presence of deep-sea vents. These hydrothermal 
vents are geological formations that spew forth mineral-rich, superheated water into the surrounding environment. 
They create a haven for unique ecosystems, sustained, again, not by sunlight but by chemosynthesis. Bacteria and other 
organisms near these vents convert chemicals, such as hydrogen sulfide, into energy, forming the basis of a 
food chain that supports a variety of organisms, including tube worms, clams, and unique species found nowhere else on Earth.
