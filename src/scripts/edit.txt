Here the flora is primarily phytoplankton and zooplankton and some diatoms. The fauna is. Fish include
the lanternfish, hatchetfish, and dragonfishs. These fish have evolved large eyes and bioluminescent organs,
to navigate and communicate in the dimly lit environment. Cephalopods, shrimp, and jellyfish, are also found in this zone,
all adapted to low light. It serves as a crucial feeding ground for migratory species, 
including whales and large predatory fish, as they follow the vertical migration of zooplankton from the depths to the surface. 
Dead matter drifts down from the euphotic zone sustains sustaining a complex food web.

Understanding the dysphotic pelagic zone is essential for comprehending the dynamics of the global carbon cycle. The zone plays a crucial 
role in the sequestration of carbon dioxide through the biological pump, where carbon is transported from the surface to the deep ocean 
through sinking particles. This process helps regulate atmospheric carbon levels and mitigates climate change.
