The Trieste Submarine Expedition of 1960.

The Trieste was a Swiss-designed, Italian-built deep-diving research submarine. Following its 
acquisition by the U.S. Navy in 1958, the submarine was subjected to numerous modifications to 
prepare it for the monumental task ahead. Among the most significant of these modifications was 
the installment of a new and larger gasoline-filled float, marking a technological advancement 
in deep-sea navigation.

On January 23, 1960, the Trieste, manned by Jacques Piccard (son of the submarine's designer 
Auguste Piccard) and U.S. Navy Lieutenant Don Walsh, embarked on its audacious journey to the 
Mariana Trench. Known as the deepest part of the world's oceans, the trench presented an alluring 
yet daunting challenge. Never before had humans ventured into such extreme depths, and the mission 
held an undeniable aura of trepidation and uncertainty.

The descent took almost five hours, a slow and methodical progression into the abyss. The two-man crew 
endured freezing temperatures and the crushing pressure of the deep ocean, an environment as hostile to 
humans as the vacuum of space. The Trieste's pressure sphere, where Piccard and Walsh were stationed, 
became their tiny haven in the dark, icy-cold depths.

Upon reaching the bottom of the Mariana Trench, specifically the Challenger Deep, the Trieste had descended 
a record-breaking 35,814 feet (approximately 10,916 meters) below sea level. Here, in the silent and 
pitch-dark world, Piccard and Walsh spent approximately twenty minutes, capturing images of the seafloor 
and documenting their observations. Contrary to expectations, they noted the presence of life at such 
extreme depths, shattering preconceived notions about the limits of life on Earth.

The ascent back to the surface was equally laborious, taking over three hours. Upon reaching the surface, 
the Trieste was greeted by an elated team. The mission had been a success, not just technically, but also 
symbolically, underlining human tenacity and courage in the face of immense challenges.

The Trieste's expedition had a far-reaching impact on marine science and technology. It pushed the boundaries 
of human understanding of the deep ocean environment and its biodiversity, and proved that it was possible 
for humans to venture into the deepest parts of our planet. The dive also spurred developments in submarine 
technology, paving the way for further deep-sea exploration and research.

In the years since the historic 1960 dive, humans have returned to the Challenger Deep only a handful 
of times, a testament to the complexity and challenges associated with such undertakings. Yet, the legacy 
of the Trieste endures. It continues to inspire a new generation of explorers, driving them to push the 
boundaries of human knowledge and capability.

The Trieste's journey into the depths of the Mariana Trench serves as a reminder of our planet's vast 
unexplored frontiers. It symbolizes the human spirit of exploration and the relentless pursuit of knowledge, 
underscoring our enduring fascination with the unknown. Even as we reach for the stars, the depths of our oceans 
hold mysteries that continue to draw us in, captivate us, and challenge our understanding of life on Earth.



A bathyscaphe is a type of deep-sea submersible that is designed to withstand the intense pressure 
found at ocean depths. The term "bathyscaphe" is derived from the Greek words 'bathus', meaning 
'deep', and 'skaphe', meaning 'ship' or 'vessel'.

The bathyscaphe was first developed by the Swiss physicist Auguste Piccard in the 1930s and 
1940s. Unlike earlier submersibles, which had their structures on the outside, bathyscaphes have 
a small, strong cabin for the crew, with a lightweight float filled with gasoline for buoyancy. 
The gasoline was used because it is incompressible, allowing the bathyscaphe to maintain buoyancy 
even at extreme depths.

The most famous bathyscaphe is probably the Trieste, which was designed by Auguste Piccard and his 
son Jacques. On January 23, 1960, the Trieste descended to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the 
deepest part of the world's oceans, with Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh on board.

Bathyscaphes were the first vehicles to enable manned exploration of the ocean depths. Today, 
remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are more commonly 
used for deep-sea exploration, although manned submersibles are still used for certain scientific 
and exploratory missions.
